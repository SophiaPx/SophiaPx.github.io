Welcome! I am a first-year CS PhD student at [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Prof. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).


I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). I also worked with [Prof. Tianxing He](https://cloudygoose.github.io/) at Tsinghua University and [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/) at University of Washington.

My research interests lie broadly in Language and Vision, particularly in:
- Trustworthy AI: detecting machine-generated text ([EMNLP 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.318/)), and removing LLM watermarks ([NAACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01222)).
- Evaluation: building an extrinsic evaluation framework for text summarization ([COLING 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.821/)).
- Efficiency: compressing prompts ([EMNLP 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.851/)), evaluating and mitigating overthinking in reasoning models ([CoLM 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13367)).

_(Only [co-]lead-author papers are listed.)_

I am actively looking for motivated undergraduate or master's students to collaborate on exciting topics such as multimodal evaluation, reasoning, and more.
