I am a first-year PhD student at UC Santa Barbara advised by [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).



I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). I also worked with [Tianxing He](https://cloudygoose.github.io/) at Tsinghua University and [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/) at University of Washington.

I do research in the field of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Specially, I am interested in:
- Evaluation for LLMs: How to design better evaluation methods that evolves with LLM's ability?
- NLP Safety: detection of machine-generated text and text watermarks.
- Multi-agent Interaction

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
