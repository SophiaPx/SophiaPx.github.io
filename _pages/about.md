Welcome! I am a first-year CS PhD student at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Prof. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/).



I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). I also worked with [Prof. Tianxing He](https://cloudygoose.github.io/) at Tsinghua University and [Prof. Yulia Tsvetkov](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/) at University of Washington.

I do research broadly in the field of Natural Language Processing. Specially, I am interested in:
- NLG Evaluation ([COLING 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.821/), [AAAI 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07967), [CL 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01383))
- NLP Safety: machine-generated text detection ([EMNLP 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.318/), [ACL 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.160/)), watermarks ([arXiv 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01222)) and more.
- Prompt Compression ([EMNLP 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.851/))
- Data Selection for Reasoning (ongoing work)
